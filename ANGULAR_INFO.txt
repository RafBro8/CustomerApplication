TypeScript.ts - allows to write code from other languages
like Java or C (object oriented languages), compiles this code to JavaScript,
and puts it in dist folder in the project

Angular is made in TypeScript
Angular is a binding framework:
View (HTML) <-> Binding Code ( whatever name like: Presenter or, View Model or, Controller or, Code Behind) <-> Model (JavaScript Object)
MVW Model

src - source code
app - all the code for Angular
 - component - binds UI and Model code
 - module - group of multiple Components

EX:
Component

export class AppComponent {
  title = 'CustomerApplication';
}

HTML/UI

<h1>
  Welcome to {{ title }}!
</h1>

{{ title }} - expression display values/properties of a Component on a UI

@Component - decorator - defines how Component should work and binds HTML/CSS and Component

need to export Component in order to be able to import it


Module - groups Components
decorator for Module is @NgModule
@NgModule - declarations: list of Components
          - bootstrap: specifies the startup/main Component




use command tsc - command for TypeScript - compile ts files
to js and put into dist folder

dist folder - finally compiled folder - final compiled JavaScript -
ts files get compiled to js files

node_modules - all npm installs get copied to this folder

e2e - end to end testing, whitebox test will fire up the src code

Main Project components:
Angular, Node, TypeScript
all 3 have their own config files:
angular.json
 - sourceRoot - source code
 - architect - which builders will run for which commands

package.json - dev dependencies don't go to prod, only used during development phase in IDE

tsconfig.json - how compilation of TypeScript should be done

Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors
tslint.json - used during linting process

Root (App) (tsconfig.json - Root config)
- CustomerApplication (Code) (tsconfig.app.json - App config override Root)
- CustomerApplication (Test)

ng build - command to take what is in src code to compile it to dist folder, then dist folder can be taken to Prod

main.ts - defines/bootstraps the Main/Startup Module of the project
index.html - invokes the Main/Startup Module
1. index.html starts (loaded in user browser for example)
2. index.html calls main.ts
3. main.ts calls the CustomerAppMainModule (main/startup module) using platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(CustomerAppMainModule)
4. CustomerAppMainModule loads the AppComponent using bootstrap: [AppComponent]
5. AppComponents loads the HTML


<app-root></app-root> - selector - AppComponent HTML runs inside this section
located also in:
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',


polyfills.ts -  help you run new ES version of JavaScript on old browsers which does not support it

Before going live:
1. ts files need to be compiled to js files
2. Bundle Modules/Components together
3. Take CSS and HTML files and put them in dist/final folder

All of the above is done by Webpack Package Manager
in Angular to use webpack, run command ng build

after Build process:
runtime.js - this is for webpack runtime
vendor.js - this is the actual project code which you coded (Component, Modules and Model)
main.js - this points to the first module of your project
styles.js - All CSS code goes here

when running ng server command everything is loaded/saved in memory
to run from harddrive - need to put in url like this - http://localhost:4200/dist/AppName
default url is - http://localhost:4200/

ngModel - () sends data from UI to the object
          [] receives data from UI to object


Angular file naming convention - Angular Style Guide-
App Name + Component.ts, ex: CustomerApp.CustomerComponent.ts
App Name + Module.ts, ex: CustomerApp.MainModule.ts
also app.component.css and app.component.html
Component has css, html and code
You can change naming as needed for your project and needs

Bindings are one or two way:
UI -> Component
UI <- Component
UI <-> Component
(), [] one way binding
[ ( ) ] - two way binding


UI - Component - Model


package-lock.json - has all the absolute version entries after npm version resolution using ~ and ^

ex: version 6.1.0
6 = Major version
1 = Minor version
0 = Revision

Major version - breaking changes
Minor version - new features, no breaking
Revision - bug fixes, patches, no breaking

to see all version of some module - use npm view modulename versions

npm does not increment the latest major version automatically with carrot ^ - need to do manually
ex: go from 1.0.0 to 2.1.1 - manual update needed
npm increments only minor versions and revisions

Master Page (2.Home Page, 3.Customer Page, 4.Supplier Page) - define uniform look and feel for the site
Master Page (CustomerApp.MasterPageView.component.html)
Home Page (CustomerApp.HomePageView.component.html)
Customer Page (CustomerApp.CustomerView.component.html)
Supplier Page (CustomerApp.SupplierView.component.html)

Angular UI should always have Angular Component for it
Master Page (CustomerApp.MasterPageView.component.html) -> CustomerApp.MasterPage.ts (handles MasterPage View)
Home Page (CustomerApp.HomePageView.component.html) -> CustomerApp.HomeComponent.ts (handles Home View)
Customer Page (CustomerApp.CustomerView.component.html) -> CustomerApp.CustomerComponent.ts (handles Customer View)
Supplier Page (CustomerApp.SupplierView.component.html) -> CustomerApp.SupplierComponent.ts (handles Supplier View)

Home folder - Master Page and Home Page code

CustomerApp.MainModule.ts will handle Customer Component, Supplier Component, Home Component, so leave file outside of any folders

Only the Customer has a Model currently

index.html -> main.ts -> Module.ts -> Component -> UI -> Selector in index.html (<app-root></app-root>)
in index.html app-root only the Master Page will load
the rest of tge pages (Customer, Supplier, Home) will load inside the Master Page
like - <a href="Home">Home</a><br>   <a href="Customer">Customer</a><br>    etc
Only CustomerApp.MasterPageComponent.ts should have   selector: 'app-root'

bootstrap defines which is startup Component to be loaded first
declarations define which subsequent Components will be loaded after startup Component

templateUrl in MasterPage Component takes the MasterPage and loads it into index.html Selector

in CustomerApp.MasterPageView.component.html Routing (Routing Collection) helps load the other Components like:
Home, Customer, Supplier, into <div> tags
ex: href/uri   /Customer/   Customer Component   ---load into ---> Master Page
Routing fields: url/href and matching Component
path: 'Home', component: HomeComponent

in CustomerApp.MasterPageView.component.html, in <div> tags put <router-outlet></router-outlet>
router-outlet - reserved tag
change <a href="Home">Home</a><br>   to <a [routerLink]="['Home']">Home</a><br>
need to import/setup Routing in MainModule file as well

2 phases: Loading Master Page -> Navigating Master Page
Loading Master Page:
index.html --> <script> --> main.ts --Platform Browser Dynamic --> Main Module -- Bootstrap --> Masterpage Component -- Template Url --> MasterPage View
index.html <-- <selector> -- Masterpage Component <-- Masterpage View

Navigating Master Page:
Master Page -- [routerlink] /customer/ --> Router Collection -- Lookup in Collection --> Customer Component -- Template Url --> Customer View
Master Page (<router-outlet></router-outlet>) <-- Load in router outlet element -- Customer Component <-- Customer View

Lazy Loading
At first load of page, everything is loaded, all Components are loaded, which affects performance
with Lazy Loading only the Home and Masterpage Components should be loaded
Lazy loading - on click/on demand, load other Components when clicking, when needed
1st step is to divide project into self contained Angular modules
without Lazy Loading, all Components are loaded from Main Module
create Main Module (Masterpage and Home Components), create Customer Module (Customer Component),
create Supplier Module (Supplier Component)
also split into different Routes (Home, Customer, Supplier)

loadChildren (dynamic loading) - load subsequent Components dynamically in Main Routing file,
when clicking on href link then that Component will be loaded
ex: in Main Routing -   { path: 'Customer', loadChildren: '../Customer/CustomerApp.CustomerModule#CustomerModule'},

example Route Url:
Customer/Add - Customer is Root route, Add is Child route
Customer/Delete - Customer is Root route, Delete is Child route
Supplier/Add - Supplier is Root route, Add is Child route
Root route is defined in Main Routes (forRoot in Module.ts file)
Child route is loaded with loadChildren (forChild in Module.ts file)
forRoot - use only in Main Module

Browser Module - only for Main Module
Common Module - Customer Module and Supplier Module

webpack bundling engine - finds imports and starts bundling modules with main.ts

Angular Validation

1. There is a UI
2. On UI there are UI controls (text boxes, buttons, dropdowns, etc)
3. On UI controls we apply zero, one,  or many validation

Component connects UI and Model
Model = Logic + Data
Validation should be put in the Model (Logic)
Import NgForm, FormGroup, FormControl, Validators, FormBuilder from @angular/forms into CustomerApp.model.ts
FormBuilder helps create tree object model of FormGroup, FormControl, Validators

Using and applying Angular validation (CCC process)
1. Create - create validation tree, create validation object model (FormGroup, FormControl, Validators)
2. Connect - connect validation object model to the UI
3. Check - IsValid, IsDirty, valid or not valid?

FormBuilder (constructor(){ }) - const _builder = new FormBuilder();

Once validation model is created, it needs to be connected to the UI
in UI need to wrap code to validate into <form></form> tags
then put FormGroup inside these <form></form> tags in UI file
amd put formControlName in <input> tags in the UI

dirty flag - to not see exception messages in validations right away, messages show when user inputs something


Dependency Injection (DI) - centralized control on how the changes will happen

Centralized and Conditional DI
Centralized - use Provider, manage dependencies centrally, inject on Constructor
Conditional - client decides what kind of Object it wants to use

Injector and Tokens in Conditional DI
Tokens - values (string, number, etc) you can use to point to specific classes/objects to use, Lookup injector.get()

ex (Module): { provide: '1', useClass: DbLogger },
    { provide: '2', useClass: ConsoleLogger }

To inject conditionally, client will need Injector object

ex (Component):  constructor(_injector: Injector) {
                     this.Logobj = _injector.get('1');



When creating an Interface (ILogger for example) that has code implementation that is used in multiple places
like class ConsoleLogger being used in some Components, when new Logger is created in ILogger, it might require changes across the board where
ILogger interface is used
All classes point to ILogger, but actual Object Creation ( Logobj: ILogger = new ConsoleLogger();) should happen somewhere else
Provider (Object Creation Centrally) --Inject--> to Components
ILogger references different Logger classes
Provider works with ILogger to create which Object to create
Provider should be loaded from a file that loads on the beginning like Main Module
ex:   providers: [{
        provide: BaseLogger,
        useClass: ConsoleLogger
      }],
Provider does Dependency Injection for Components that use the Interface

Interfaces are not use in JavaScript. They are syntax sugar in TypeScript, but there is no equivalent in JavaScript
to prevent Interface issues, create base class in Interface to implement Interface code in it and leave Interface empty
and have other classes extend this base class instead of implementing the Interface
ex: export class BaseLogger implements ILogger


Dynamic collections (make Provider dynamic instead of hardcoded:
Can use:

var providerscollection:any = [];
providerscollection.push({provide: "1", useClass: DbLogger})   - ConditionalDI
providerscollection.push({provide: BaseLogger, useClass: ConsoleLogger}) - Centralized DI
In Module - providers: [providerscollection]

Instead of:
 providers: [{
    provide: BaseLogger,
    useClass: ConsoleLogger
  },
    { provide: '1', useClass: DbLogger },

Classes in Angular are termed as Services

Good architecture - Change at one place should not lead to change at many places
